/* Week 3 / Ex4 -- task_alpha and task_beta share two resources, protected by
 * two mutexes, mimicking a sensor register + a shared UART buffer that both
 * tasks occasionally need at once. This file is provided complete, not a
 * skeleton: build and run it exactly as given first and use
 * uxTaskGetSystemState() to find out why it stops making progress, before
 * you change anything in here. Native FreeRTOS API only.
